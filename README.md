## Description
This project is a React.js front end with a Node.js, GraphQL, and Mongo backend that acts as a book search engine. This gives users the ability to search for, and save books to their reading list and uses React components to render the frontend with Apollo GraphQL hooks to interact with the backend.

See the deployed application [here](https://arcane-inlet-51935.herokuapp.com).
